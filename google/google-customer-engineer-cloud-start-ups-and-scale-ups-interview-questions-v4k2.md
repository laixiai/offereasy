*   **Points of Assessment**: This question evaluates your technical architecture skills, your ability to connect technical solutions to business needs, and your understanding of startup constraints (e.g., cost, scalability, speed to market).
*   **Standard Answer**: "I worked with a fintech startup that needed to process a high volume of transactions with low latency while maintaining strict security compliance and controlling costs. Their primary constraints were a tight budget and the need to scale rapidly after launch. I designed a serverless microservices architecture using Google Cloud Functions for processing, Firestore for scalable data storage, and Cloud Armor for security. This approach minimized upfront infrastructure costs by using a pay-as-you-go model and allowed for automatic, seamless scaling as their user base grew. I also implemented robust monitoring with Cloud Operations to ensure high availability and quick issue resolution, directly addressing their need for reliability without a large operations team."
*   **Common Pitfalls**:
    *   Focusing only on the technical details without explaining the "why" behind your decisions.
    *   Proposing an overly complex or expensive solution that isn't practical for an early-stage company.
*   **Potential Follow-up Questions**:
    *   What trade-offs did you have to make in your design?
    *   How did you ensure the solution was cost-effective?
    *   How would this architecture evolve as the company scaled 10x?

*   **Standard Answer**: "When presenting to a mixed audience, I structure my communication in layers. I start with a high-level executive summary that focuses on the business outcome and value proposition, which resonates with the CTO and product managers. Then, I'll dive into the architectural overview, explaining the 'what' and 'why' of the solution's components, which is relevant to everyone. For the deep-dive technical details, I'll address the engineers directly, discussing implementation specifics, APIs, and code-level considerations, but I'll frame it in a way that others can still follow the logic. I make sure to pause frequently for questions and tailor my answers to the person asking, ensuring everyone stays engaged and aligned."
*   **Common Pitfalls**:
    *   Being too technical for the entire presentation, losing the business stakeholders.
