The interviewer wants to see if you can think strategically and communicate a complex project clearly.
*   **Standard Answer**: "In a previous role, I worked with a retail client struggling with siloed data from their e-commerce platform, in-store POS systems, and inventory management. The business problem was an inability to get a unified view of customer behavior and optimize stock levels in real-time. I designed a solution on Google Cloud starting with Pub/Sub to ingest streaming sales data, which fed into a Dataflow pipeline for real-time transformation and enrichment. This processed data was then loaded into BigQuery, which served as their central analytics warehouse. We used Looker for visualization, creating dashboards for marketing and supply chain teams. The outcome was a 15% reduction in stockouts and a 10% increase in marketing campaign ROI due to better customer segmentation."
*   **Common Pitfalls**: Giving a purely technical answer without mentioning the business impact. Failing to explain *why* specific technologies were chosen over alternatives.
*   **Potential Follow-up Questions**:
    *   What were the main technical challenges you faced during implementation?
    *   How did you ensure the solution was scalable and cost-effective?
    *   What alternatives did you consider, and why did you choose this specific architecture?

### Question 2：A potential customer is concerned about the security and data governance of moving their sensitive financial data to Google Cloud. How would you address their concerns?

    *   What partitioning and clustering strategy would you recommend for the BigQuery tables?
    *   How would you monitor the health and performance of both pipelines?

### Question 4：A customer's data warehouse query in BigQuery is running slowly. What are the first five things you would investigate to troubleshoot the performance?
*   **Points of Assessment**: Evaluates your practical troubleshooting skills and your deep knowledge of BigQuery's architecture and optimization techniques.
*   **Standard Answer**: "First, I would examine the query execution plan using the 'Query details' tab in the BigQuery UI to identify the most time-consuming stages. Second, I'd check for data skew, where one worker is processing a disproportionate amount of data. Third, I would analyze the query for inefficient patterns, such as using `SELECT *` instead of specific columns or performing complex joins on non-partitioned/clustered fields. Fourth, I'd review the table's schema to see if partitioning and clustering are being used effectively to prune data. Fifth, I would investigate if the query is causing slot contention, and if so, discuss whether reserved slots or a different query schedule would be appropriate."
*   **Common Pitfalls**: Suggesting solutions without a clear diagnostic process. Focusing only on the SQL query itself and ignoring the underlying table structure.
*   **Potential Follow-up Questions**:
    *   Explain the difference between partitioning and clustering in BigQuery.
    *   When would you recommend using the BigQuery BI Engine?
    *   How can you estimate the cost of a query before running it?

### Question 5：Walk me through how you would prepare and deliver a technical presentation to a C-level executive (e.g., a CTO) versus a team of data engineers.
*   **Points of Assessment**: This question assesses your communication skills and your ability to tailor your message to different audiences.
*   **Standard Answer**: "For a CTO, my presentation would focus on the 'why' – the business value and strategic impact. I'd use clear, concise language, focusing on outcomes like reduced TCO, increased business agility, and competitive advantage through data-driven insights. I would use high-level architecture diagrams and emphasize security, scalability, and ROI. For a team of data engineers, the presentation would be much more technical, focusing on the 'how'. I would dive deep into the specific services, showcasing code snippets, detailed architecture patterns, and best practices for implementation.

*   **Points of Assessment**: Assesses your fundamental knowledge of data engineering patterns and your ability to apply them in a cloud context.
*   **Standard Answer**: "ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) involves transforming data in a separate processing engine *before* loading it into the target data warehouse. ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) involves loading raw data directly into the warehouse and then using the warehouse's power to perform transformations. On Google Cloud, I would recommend an ETL approach using Cloud Dataflow when complex, row-level transformations are needed, or when data needs to be enriched from external sources before it even lands in the warehouse. I would recommend an ELT approach for most modern data warehousing use cases with BigQuery. Its immense processing power makes it highly efficient to load raw data into staging tables and then use SQL to perform transformations in place, which simplifies the pipeline and leverages the full power of the data warehouse."
*   **Common Pitfalls**: Being unable to clearly define both terms. Not providing practical, cloud-specific examples for each pattern.
