*   **Standard Answer**: "For a feature like this, I'd use a balanced set of metrics. Quantitatively, I would track adoption metrics like the percentage of BigQuery users who enable the feature and the daily active usage. I would also measure task success rate, such as the percentage of natural language queries that successfully generate valid SQL. For business impact, I'd monitor the correlation between feature usage and increased overall BigQuery consumption. Qualitatively, I would rely on user satisfaction surveys (NPS/CSAT) with targeted questions about the feature's accuracy and utility. I would also conduct regular user interviews and usability testing to understand the 'why' behind the quantitative data, focusing on how much time and effort the feature is saving them."
*   **Common Pitfalls**: Listing only vanity metrics (e.g., number of queries) without tying them to user success. Forgetting to include qualitative metrics to understand user sentiment. Proposing metrics that are difficult or impossible to measure.
*   **Potential Follow-up Questions**:
    *   Which of these metrics do you consider the most important "north star" metric?
    *   How would you react if adoption was high but user satisfaction was low?
    *   How would you build a dashboard to track these metrics for stakeholders?

The quantitative data was inconclusive. I had to make a call to move forward. My decision framework was to align with our core product principles, one of which was 'developer trust.' I reasoned that inaccurate code suggestions, even if delivered quickly, would erode trust and lead to abandonment. Therefore, I made the decision to prioritize accuracy, while setting a minimum acceptable latency target. I communicated my reasoning clearly to the team and stakeholders, and we established a plan to heavily instrument the feature upon release to gather more data and be ready to iterate quickly."
*   **Common Pitfalls**: Claiming you always have enough data. Describing a situation where you just made a gut call without a clear rationale. Failing to explain how you mitigated the risk of the decision.
*   **Potential Follow-up Questions**:
    *   Was your decision ultimately the right one? How did you know?
    *   How do you create a framework for your team to make decisions when you're not available?
    *   How do you communicate risk and uncertainty to leadership?

### Question 9：How would you bridge the communication gap between a team of highly technical AI researchers and a sales team that needs to sell the product?
*   **Points of Assessment**: This question evaluates your communication and stakeholder management skills. It's critical for a PM in this role to be able to translate between technical and business worlds.

For the sales team, I would develop clear, jargon-free documentation, including battle cards, one-pagers, and customer-facing presentations that focus on the 'what' and 'why'—the key customer problems the product solves and its unique value proposition. I would avoid getting bogged down in the technical 'how.' For the research team, I would translate market feedback and customer needs into well-defined problems and requirements they can get excited about solving. I would also facilitate regular forums, like product demos and 'ask me anything' sessions, where both teams can interact directly in a structured way, which helps build empathy and mutual respect."
*   **Common Pitfalls**: Suggesting the teams should just talk to each other without a facilitator. Providing only one-way communication (e.g., only training the sales team). Underestimating the importance of building relationships and empathy between the two groups.
*   **Potential Follow-up Questions**:
    *   Describe a specific instance where you had to translate a complex technical concept for a non-technical audience.
    *   How do you ensure that customer feedback from the sales team gets incorporated into the product roadmap?
    *   How would you handle a situation where the sales team overpromises a feature?
