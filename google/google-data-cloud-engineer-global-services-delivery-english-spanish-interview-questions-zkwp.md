    *   How do you balance the customer's best interest with Google's business objectives?
    *   How do you earn trust with a non-technical executive versus a senior engineer?

### Question 10：How would you approach designing a machine learning solution for a customer who has a large dataset but an undefined business problem?
*   **Points of Assessment**: Evaluates your experience with the practical application of machine learning, your business acumen, and your consultative approach to problem-solving.
*   **Standard Answer**: "My first step would be to facilitate a series of workshops with the customer's business stakeholders to translate their vague goals into a concrete, measurable business problem that ML can solve. We would explore potential use cases like customer churn prediction, demand forecasting, or product recommendation. I would then perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to assess the quality and predictive power of their dataset. Based on the defined problem and the data, I would propose a proof-of-concept using a service like BigQuery ML or Vertex AI to quickly demonstrate potential value before committing to a full-scale MLOps implementation."
*   **Common Pitfalls**: Jumping directly into discussing ML models and algorithms without first defining the business problem. Assuming the available data is suitable for any ML task without an analysis phase.
*   **Potential Follow-up Questions**:
    *   How do you measure the ROI of an ML project?
    *   What are some key considerations when building an MLOps pipeline on GCP?
    *   How would you explain the limitations and risks of a machine learning model to a customer?
