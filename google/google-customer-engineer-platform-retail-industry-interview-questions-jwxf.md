*   **Potential Follow-up Questions**:
    *   What are some common mistakes you see teams make when first adopting Kubernetes?
    *   How would you introduce the concept of 'Infrastructure as Code' using Terraform for managing GKE?
    *   Which GKE mode—Standard or Autopilot—would you recommend for this team and why?

### Question 9：A retail customer's website crashed during a flash sale, causing significant revenue loss. In the debrief, how would you position Google Cloud's reliability and SRE principles as a solution?
*   **Points of Assessment**: Assesses your empathy, your ability to turn a negative event into a constructive opportunity, and your knowledge of Site Reliability Engineering (SRE).
*   **Standard Answer**: "First, I would express empathy for their situation, acknowledging the business impact. I would then explain that Google runs its own critical services like Search and Gmail using a set of principles called Site Reliability Engineering, and that we've built those same principles into Google Cloud. I would introduce concepts like Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and error budgets, explaining how they can help the customer make data-driven decisions about reliability versus feature velocity. I'd propose a solution using Google Cloud's managed services like GKE and a Global Load Balancer, which have high uptime SLAs built-in. I would suggest a follow-up workshop on implementing SRE practices, including proactive monitoring with Cloud Operations, to help them move from a reactive to a proactive approach to reliability."
*   **Common Pitfalls**: Blaming the customer for their poor architecture. Jumping straight into a technical solution without showing empathy. Being unable to explain core SRE concepts simply.

The problem was their monolithic application couldn't scale to handle the thousands of images uploaded daily. I designed an event-driven, serverless solution using Google Cloud. When an image was uploaded to a Cloud Storage bucket, it would trigger a Cloud Function. This function would resize the image, optimize it for the web, and use the Vision AI API to automatically generate product tags for search. The results were then stored in a separate CDN-ready bucket. The outcome was a 90% reduction in the time-to-market for new products and a significant decrease in manual effort, freeing up their team to focus on other tasks."
*   **Common Pitfalls**: Choosing a project that is too simple. Being unable to explain the architecture or the business outcome clearly. Taking credit for work that was clearly a team effort without acknowledging collaborators.
*   **Potential Follow-up Questions**:
    *   What were the biggest technical challenges you faced during implementation?
    *   Why did you choose Cloud Functions over, say, a service running on Cloud Run?
    *   How did you monitor the performance and cost of this serverless solution?
