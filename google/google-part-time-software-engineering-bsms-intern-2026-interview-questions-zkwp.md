## 10 Typical Part-Time Software Engineering BS/MS Intern, 2026 Interview Questions

### Question 1：Given an array of integers, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.
*   **Points of Assessment**:
    *   Evaluates the candidate's knowledge of algorithms, specifically dynamic programming or the Kadane's algorithm approach.
    *   Tests problem-solving skills and the ability to optimize a solution from a brute-force approach.
    *   Assesses the ability to analyze time and space complexity.
*   **Standard Answer**: "A brute-force approach would be to check all possible subarrays, which would be O(n^2). A more optimal solution is Kadane's algorithm, which solves this problem in O(n) time. The idea is to iterate through the array and keep track of two variables: `max_so_far` and `current_max`. `current_max` is the maximum sum of the subarray ending at the current position, which is either the current element itself or the current element plus the previous `current_max`. `max_so_far` is the overall maximum sum seen, which is updated whenever `current_max` exceeds it. This single-pass approach is highly efficient and requires only constant extra space."
*   **Common Pitfalls**:
    *   Failing to handle the case where all numbers are negative (the answer should be the largest negative number).
    *   Providing only the brute-force solution without discussing its inefficiency or moving towards an optimal one.
*   **Potential Follow-up Questions**:
    *   How would you modify this to return the start and end indices of the subarray?
    *   What if the array was circular?
    *   Can you explain the time and space complexity of your solution?

### Question 2：Describe a project you've worked on (personal, academic, or professional) that you are proud of. What was your specific role and what challenges did you face?
*   **Points of Assessment**:
    *   Assesses practical experience and the ability to apply technical skills.
    *   Evaluates communication skills and the ability to articulate technical concepts clearly.
    *   Reveals problem-solving skills, ownership, and passion for technology.
*   **Standard Answer**: "I'm particularly proud of a web application I developed for a university course to help students manage their study schedules. I was responsible for both the front-end, which I built using JavaScript and React, and the back-end API using Python and Flask. A major challenge was designing a database schema that could efficiently handle recurring events and user notifications. I overcame this by researching different modeling techniques and implementing a system with separate tables for events and notification rules, which reduced query times. Another challenge was ensuring the application was responsive, which I addressed using CSS Flexbox and media queries. The project taught me a lot about full-stack development and the importance of planning before coding."
*   **Common Pitfalls**:
    *   Being too vague about their specific contributions ("we did this" instead of "I did this").
    *   Failing to explain the purpose of the project or the technical challenges involved.
*   **Potential Follow-up Questions**:
    *   What trade-offs did you have to make in your design?
    *   If you could start over, what would you do differently?
    *   How did you test your application to ensure it was working correctly?

### Question 3：Explain the difference between a process and a thread. Why would you use one over the other?
*   **Points of Assessment**:
    *   Tests fundamental knowledge of operating systems concepts.
    *   Assesses understanding of concurrency and parallelism.
    *   Evaluates the ability to reason about system performance and resource management.
*   **Standard Answer**: "A process is an instance of a program in execution, with its own private memory space. A thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process, and multiple threads within the same process share memory space, including code and data segments. The main difference is this memory sharing. Because threads share memory, communication between them is faster and less resource-intensive than inter-process communication. I would use multiple threads for tasks within a single application that can run concurrently, like handling multiple client requests in a web server. I would use multiple processes for running separate, isolated applications or when memory protection is critical to prevent one task from crashing another."
*   **Common Pitfalls**:
    *   Confusing the two concepts or using the terms interchangeably.
    *   Not being able to provide practical examples of when to use each.
*   **Potential Follow-up Questions**:
    *   What are some of the challenges of multi-threaded programming?
    *   How do threads communicate with each other?
    *   What is a race condition and how can you prevent it?

### Question 4：You are given a very large file of strings, but you only have a limited amount of RAM. How would you find the most frequent string in that file?
*   **Points of Assessment**:
    *   Evaluates problem-solving skills with constraints (limited memory).
    *   Tests knowledge of data structures (hash maps) and external sorting/processing techniques.
    *   Assesses the ability to break down a large problem into manageable parts.
*   **Standard Answer**: "Since the file is too large to fit into RAM, I cannot simply read it all and use a hash map to count frequencies. A better approach would be to process the file in chunks. I would read a chunk of the file that fits into memory, use a hash map to count the frequencies of strings within that chunk, and then store these intermediate counts to a temporary file. I would repeat this for all chunks. After processing the entire file, I would have multiple temporary files of string-frequency pairs. The final step is to merge these files. I can read the first line from each file and use a min-heap to efficiently find the next string in alphabetical order, aggregate its counts from all files where it appears, and keep track of the string with the highest total frequency found so far."
*   **Common Pitfalls**:
    *   Suggesting a solution that loads the entire file into memory, ignoring the constraint.
    *   Not having a clear strategy for merging the intermediate results from the chunks.
*   **Potential Follow-up Questions**:
    *   How would your approach change if you had multiple machines to solve this problem?
    *   What are the potential bottlenecks in this process?
    *   Can you estimate the memory and disk space requirements for this approach?

### Question 5：What is the purpose of a hash table (or dictionary)? Explain how it works, including collision handling.
*   **Points of Assessment**:
    *   Tests fundamental data structure knowledge.
    *   Assesses understanding of key concepts like hash functions, keys, values, and buckets.
    *   Evaluates knowledge of different collision resolution strategies.
*   **Standard Answer**: "A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values for highly efficient lookups, insertions, and deletions, typically in O(1) average time. It works by using a hash function to compute an index, or 'bucket,' from the key. The value is then stored at this index in an underlying array. A 'collision' occurs when two different keys hash to the same index. There are two main ways to handle this. The first is 'Separate Chaining,' where each bucket is the head of a linked list or another data structure. All key-value pairs that hash to the same index are stored in that list. The second is 'Open Addressing,' where if a bucket is occupied, the algorithm probes for the next empty slot in the array according to a certain sequence."
*   **Common Pitfalls**:
    *   Failing to mention collision handling, which is a critical part of the data structure.
    *   Not being able to explain the role of the hash function.
*   **Potential Follow-up Questions**:
    *   What makes a good hash function?
    *   When would a hash table's performance degrade to O(n)?
    *   Compare and contrast Separate Chaining and Open Addressing.

### Question 6：Describe a time you had to learn a new programming language or technology for a project. How did you approach it?
*   **Points of Assessment**:
    *   Evaluates learning agility and enthusiasm for tackling new problems.
    *   Assesses self-sufficiency and resourcefulness.
    *   Reveals the candidate's process for acquiring new skills.
*   **Standard Answer**: "For a personal project to build a mobile app, I needed to learn Dart and the Flutter framework. I started by going through the official documentation and completing their introductory tutorials to understand the basic syntax and core concepts like widgets and state management. To solidify my learning, I immediately started building my small application, setting achievable goals for each day. When I encountered problems I couldn't solve, I turned to resources like Stack Overflow and Flutter's community forums. I found that building something tangible, rather than just reading, was the most effective way to learn. This hands-on approach helped me become productive in a couple of weeks and successfully complete my project."
*   **Common Pitfalls**:
    *   Claiming to have learned a language but being unable to discuss its core features.
    *   Describing a purely passive learning process (e.g., "I watched some videos").
*   **Potential Follow-up Questions**:
    *   What did you find most challenging about that new technology?
    *   How does it compare to other languages/technologies you know?
    *   How do you stay up-to-date with new developments in technology?

### Question 7：How would you design a URL shortening service like Bitly?
*   **Points of Assessment**:
    *   Tests high-level system design and architectural thinking.
    *   Assesses the ability to consider scalability, availability, and performance.
    *   Evaluates understanding of components like databases, APIs, and hashing.
*   **Standard Answer**: "At a high level, a URL shortening service needs to do two things: generate a unique short URL for a given long URL, and redirect users from the short URL to the original long URL. For generation, when a user provides a long URL, the system needs to generate a unique short key, like 'aB1cDe'. This could be done by hashing the long URL or by using a counter that converts a base-10 number to a base-62 string. We would then store the mapping between the short key and the long URL in a database, likely a NoSQL database like DynamoDB for high scalability and fast key-value lookups. For redirection, when a request comes for the short URL, the service looks up the short key in the database, finds the corresponding long URL, and returns an HTTP 301 redirect response to the browser."
*   **Common Pitfalls**:
    *   Focusing only on one part of the problem (e.g., generation) and ignoring the other (redirection).
    *   Not considering potential issues like hash collisions or the need for unique keys.
*   **Potential Follow-up Questions**:
    *   How would you ensure the generated short keys are unique?
    *   How would you handle analytics, like tracking the number of clicks?
    *   What are the database schema considerations?

### Question 8：Imagine you are reviewing a teammate's code and you find a logical error. How would you handle it?
*   **Points of Assessment**:
    *   Evaluates teamwork, communication, and interpersonal skills.
    *   Assesses professionalism and the ability to give constructive feedback.
    *   Reveals the candidate's understanding of collaborative software development practices.
*   **Standard Answer**: "First, I would make sure I fully understand the code and the context of the error. I would double-check that it's a genuine mistake and not a misunderstanding on my part. Then, I would approach my teammate privately and respectfully. I wouldn't be accusatory, but rather frame it as a collaborative effort. I might say something like, 'I was looking at your code for the feature, and I had a question about this section. I'm seeing a potential issue here, could you walk me through your logic?' This opens a dialogue rather than making a criticism. The goal is to improve the quality of the code and learn from each other, not to assign blame. If it's part of a formal code review process, I would leave a clear, constructive comment explaining the potential issue and suggesting a fix."
*   **Common Pitfalls**:
    *   Describing a confrontational or arrogant approach.
    *   Suggesting to fix the code themselves without discussing it with the author first.
*   **Potential Follow-up Questions**:
    *   What if the teammate disagrees with you?
    *   Tell me about a time you received constructive criticism on your own code.
    *   What do you think are the most important elements of a good code review?

### Question 9：What happens when you type "google.com" into your browser and press Enter?
*   **Points of Assessment**:
    *   Tests broad knowledge of web technologies and networking concepts.
    *   Assesses understanding of DNS, HTTP/HTTPS, TCP/IP, and the client-server model.
    *   Evaluates the ability to explain a complex, multi-step process.
*   **Standard Answer**: "When I press Enter, the browser first checks its cache to see if it already has the IP address for google.com. If not, it will query the Domain Name System (DNS). This is a recursive process where the browser asks a resolver, which then asks a root server, a TLD server for '.com', and finally Google's authoritative name server to get the IP address. Once the browser has the IP, it opens a TCP connection with the server at that IP address. For HTTPS, this involves a TLS handshake to establish a secure, encrypted connection. The browser then sends an HTTP GET request to the server. The server processes the request and sends back an HTTP response, containing the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the Google homepage. Finally, the browser parses this content and renders the webpage for me to see."
*   **Common Pitfalls**:
    *   Missing major steps, especially the DNS lookup.
    *   Being unable to explain what acronyms like DNS or HTTP stand for or their purpose.
*   **Potential Follow-up Questions**:
    *   What is the difference between HTTP and HTTPS?
    *   What is a CDN and what role might it play in this process?
    *   What is contained in an HTTP request header?

### Question 10：How would you automate a routine task, for example, generating a daily report from a set of log files?
*   **Points of Assessment**:
    *   Directly assesses a key responsibility listed in the job description.
    *   Evaluates practical scripting and automation skills.
    *   Tests the ability to think logically and structure a solution to a common engineering problem.
*   **Standard Answer**: "To automate a daily report from log files, I would write a script, likely in Python, due to its strong libraries for file parsing and data analysis. The script would first need to identify and read the relevant log files for the day, perhaps based on a naming convention with a date stamp. I would use regular expressions to parse each line of the log files and extract the necessary information, like error counts or user activity metrics. I would then aggregate this data, for example, by counting occurrences in a dictionary. After processing all the files, the script would format the aggregated data into a human-readable report, maybe as a CSV file or a simple formatted text file. Finally, to make it run automatically every day, I would schedule this script using a cron job on a Unix/Linux system."
*   **Common Pitfalls**:
    *   Describing a manual process instead of an automated one.
    *   Not mentioning the final and most crucial step: scheduling the script to run automatically.
*   **Potential Follow-up Questions**:
    *   How would you handle errors if a log file is missing or corrupted?
    *   How could you make this script more robust or scalable?
    *   What if the report needed to be sent as an email? How would you add that functionality?
