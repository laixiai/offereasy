### Question 9：What is ladder logic, and can you provide a simple example of how it works?
*   **Points of Assessment**: Tests your fundamental knowledge of PLC programming, which is essential for troubleshooting control systems.
*   **Standard Answer**: "Ladder logic is a graphical programming language that mimics the appearance of electrical relay logic circuits. It's read from left to right, top to bottom. A simple example would be a basic motor start/stop circuit. You'd have a rung with a normally open 'Start' push-button contact in series with a normally closed 'Stop' push-button contact, which then energizes a motor starter output coil. In parallel with the 'Start' button, you'd place a normally open contact from the motor starter coil itself. This parallel contact acts as a 'seal-in' or 'latch,' so when you release the 'Start' button, the motor starter stays energized until the 'Stop' button is pressed, breaking the circuit."
