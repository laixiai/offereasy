*   **Standard Answer**: "In a previous role, a server failed to boot after a maintenance window, with no video output. My first step was to check the basics: ensuring power cables were secure and the PSU light was active. Next, I performed a minimal boot configuration by removing all non-essential components—all but one stick of RAM, the CPU, and the power supply. The server still failed to POST, so I swapped the single RAM stick with a known-good one, with no change. I then re-seated the CPU. The critical step was inspecting the motherboard for any visible damage, where I found a slightly distended capacitor near the CPU socket. I documented my findings, replaced the motherboard with a spare, systematically re-installed all components, and the server booted successfully. The process emphasized isolation of variables to pinpoint the faulty component efficiently."
*   **Common Pitfalls**: Giving a vague answer without specific steps; jumping to conclusions without ruling out simpler causes (like a loose cable).
*   **Potential Follow-up Questions**:
    *   How would you have approached this if you didn't have a spare motherboard available?
    *   What documentation did you create after resolving the issue?
    *   How would this process change if the server was remote versus physically accessible?
