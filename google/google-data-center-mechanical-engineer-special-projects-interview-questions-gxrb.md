*   **Standard Answer**: "The key differences are scale, standardization, and the focus on operational efficiency. In a hyperscale facility, the design must be massively scalable and standardized for rapid deployment across the globe. We prioritize modular designs and prefabricated components to reduce construction time. The focus on operational efficiency, particularly PUE and WUE, is relentless, driving the adoption of custom, highly optimized cooling solutions. In contrast, a smaller enterprise data center may prioritize flexibility and use more off-the-shelf equipment. The redundancy levels might be designed differently, and the tolerance for risk and capital expenditure is generally much lower, often leading to more conventional and less customized designs."
*   **Common Pitfalls**:
    *   Only stating the obvious difference ("one is bigger").
    *   Failing to connect the design differences back to the underlying business drivers (speed, cost, efficiency).
*   **Potential Follow-up Questions**:
    *   How does the approach to commissioning differ between the two types of facilities?
    *   What role does automation play in a hyperscale environment compared to an enterprise one?
    *   How does the supply chain for mechanical equipment affect your design choices in a hyperscale project?

### Question 10：How would you evaluate the success of a mechanical design project after the data center has been operational for one year?
*   **Points of Assessment**: This question assesses your focus on long-term performance and continuous improvement. It shows if you think beyond project completion and consider the full lifecycle.
*   **Standard Answer**: "One year after handover, I would evaluate the project's success against four key metrics. First, operational performance: I would analyze 12 months of operational data to compare the actual PUE and WUE against the design targets. Second, reliability: I would review incident logs with the operations team to determine the number of mechanical system-related events and assess the system's resilience. Third, operational cost: I would compare the actual energy, water, and maintenance costs against the initial operational budget. Finally, I would solicit qualitative feedback from the facilities operations team to understand the system's serviceability and ease of use. This comprehensive review allows me to validate the design and capture valuable lessons for future projects."
*   **Common Pitfalls**:
    *   Only mentioning one metric, such as PUE.
    *   Forgetting the importance of gathering feedback from the end-users (the operations team).
*   **Potential Follow-up Questions**:
    *   What would you do if you found the operational PUE was significantly higher than your design model predicted?
    *   How do you formalize the process of capturing and applying lessons learned?
    *   How do you balance initial capital cost with long-term operational cost in your designs?
